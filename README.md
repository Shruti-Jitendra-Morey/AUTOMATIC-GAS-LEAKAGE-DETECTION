# AUTOMATIC-GAS-LEAKAGE-DETECTION

INTRODUCTION:- With the development of world, the
technology is enhanced day by day with the realistic
projects and efficient work. In this project we are using
MQ-5 semiconductor sensor to detect combustible gas.
When target combustible gases exist, the sensor
conductivity is higher along with gas concentration rising.
Basically, conductivity of this sensor depends upon
concentration of the gas so it detects the gas. . If the LPG
sensing element senses any outflow from storage then the
output of this sensing element goes low. This low signal
is monitored by the Arduino UNO and it will establish the
gas outflow. Currently, the arduino will cut off the power.
Once few milliseconds delay, it conjointly activate fan for
throwing gas out.

APPLICATIONS :-
 Loss of live and property due to gas leakage will be minimized.
 Low maintainance and low operation costs.


CONCLUSION :-
After all the data had been gathered, analyzed and processed, the proponents arrived at the succeeding
conclusion. Therefore, the researchers concluded that the “Automatic Gas Leakage Detection Using
Arduino” will help a lot in terms of preventing any danger caused by gas leakage and useful as part of
safety to avoid the gas leak that can cause harmful result. It will also improve the safety of all users of
Liquefied Petroleum Gas.
